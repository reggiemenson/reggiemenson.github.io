              <p className="">Welcome to my site!</p>
              <br />
              <p>
                A long time ago, I started a journey that began with me writing
                as a young contributor in finance and the markets. I then
                proceeded to take on the challenge of entrepreneurship,
                ultimately using that experience to guide my work today,
                choosing to focus on making impactful contributions to business
                development through technology.
              </p>

                If you'd like to speak more about potential opportunities to
                take a look at the <a href="#contact">contact section</a> at the
                bottom of the page. You may find more detail on past work and
                snippets of hobby work from time to time on my profiles.

                Take a look at some of the early mini-projects that Iâ€™ve been
                involved with further below; in some cases, as an individual and
                in others, alongside some talented colleagues and friends.
